From the analysis of the claims dataset, here’s what stands out:

Most of the claims are being approved — about 7 out of 10 — which is good. But almost 1 in 5 are denied, and that’s a clear area for improvement. A small percentage of claims are still pending.

When we look at why claims are denied, the same reasons keep showing up: invalid coding, missing information, or duplicate claims. These are preventable issues, which suggests process or training gaps on the provider side.

The number of claims being submitted each month is fairly steady, but there’s a noticeable bump around the middle of the month. This probably ties to provider billing cycles, so the claims department could plan workloads around those peaks.

On the financial side, the average claim is around $1,500. Larger, high-value claims are generally getting approved, but the few that are denied represent a potential revenue risk that the business should keep an eye on.

In terms of provider performance, the big hospitals (like ABC Hospital and CityCare Hospital) are responsible for the bulk of claims. Smaller clinics tend to have higher denial rates, which points to issues with compliance or less robust processes.

Recommendations

Provide additional training for providers on claim submission rules, especially around coding and documentation.

Use automated checks before claims are submitted to catch missing info or duplicates earlier.

Track provider-level performance monthly to identify repeat issues and address them proactively.

Use the submission trend insights to better staff the claims department during peak periods.
