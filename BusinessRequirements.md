# Business Requirements Document (BRD)  
**Project**: Healthcare Claims Analysis  
**Prepared By**: Rishitha Kosuri  
**Date**: September 2025  

---

## 1. Background  
The healthcare claims adjudication process is currently inefficient.  
- ~22% of claims are denied, and almost 40% of those denials are preventable (invalid coding, missing member info, duplicate claims).  
- Average cycle time from submission to resolution is 14–18 days, which delays provider reimbursements and member satisfaction.  
- Leadership lacks visibility into denial trends, making it difficult to take corrective action.  

This project aims to analyze claims data and design dashboards to provide transparency, improve adjudication accuracy, and shorten processing times.  

---

## 2. Objectives  
1. Improve adjudication accuracy by **15–20%** through better data validation.  
2. Reduce average claim processing time from **14–18 days → 10–12 days**.  
3. Provide **real-time KPI dashboards** for Claims Managers and Finance.  
4. Identify the **top 5 denial reasons** and propose process improvements.  

---

## 3. Scope  
**In Scope**  
- Claims data analysis (submission → adjudication → payment).  
- SQL queries for denial analysis, processing times, and monthly trends.  
- Power BI dashboards for executives, claims managers, and finance.  

**Out of Scope**  
- Changes to provider-facing claim submission portals.  
- Integration with external EMR or EHR systems.  

---

## 4. Stakeholders  
- **Claims Manager** – Needs daily reports on claims status.  
- **Provider Relations Team** – Works with hospitals on denied claims.  
- **Finance Analyst** – Tracks payment timelines and cash flow.  
- **Compliance Officer** – Ensures adherence to HIPAA guidelines.  
- **IT/Data Team** – Supports SQL and dashboard implementation.  

---

## 5. Functional Requirements  
1. Ability to query claims by **status** (Approved, Denied, Pending).  
2. Filter claims by **provider, region, or insurance plan**.  
3. Generate **KPI dashboard**:  
   - Claim approval/denial rates  
   - Average processing time  
   - Denial reasons (top 5)  
4. Export data to **Excel/PDF** for audits.  

---

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements  
- Dashboard refresh frequency: **daily at 6 AM**.  
- Maximum dashboard load time: **3 seconds**.  
- Must comply with **HIPAA privacy/security standards**.  

---

## 7. Success Metrics  
- 15–20% reduction in adjudication errors.  
- 20–25% faster claims cycle time.  
- KPI dashboard adopted by **100% of Claims Managers** within 2 months.
