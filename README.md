# Healthcare Claims Analysis  

This project demonstrates how a Business Analyst approaches the optimization of healthcare claims processing. It showcases real-world BA deliverables — from requirements gathering to SQL analysis and dashboard reporting — in the insurance and healthcare domain.

## 📊 Project Overview  
The healthcare claims process often suffers from high denial rates, long processing cycles, and limited transparency for stakeholders. This project simulates a case study where I:  
- Documented **business requirements** and **user stories** for claims optimization  
- Designed a **process workflow** to highlight adjudication paths  
- Wrote **SQL queries** to analyze denial reasons, cycle times, and provider performance  
- Created a **Power BI dashboard** (mocked with sample data) to present KPIs to leadership  

The objective is to show end-to-end Business Analyst skills in documentation, data analysis, and visualization.

## 🚀 Key Insights (From Analysis)  
- ~22% of claims were denied; ~40% of denials were preventable (invalid coding, missing info)  
- Average claim cycle time reduced from **14–18 days → 10–12 days** with proposed process improvements  
- Top 5 denial reasons accounted for 70% of rejections — addressing these can improve accuracy by **15–20%**  
- Provider-level performance analysis revealed high variation in approval rates across regions
